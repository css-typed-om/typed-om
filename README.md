# What is this?
This is a proof-of-concept polyfill for the proposed [Typed CSSOM API](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/css-typed-om-1/).

# Using this Polyfill
To use the code, download this repository and put
```
<script src='typed-om/typed-om.js'></script>
```
in your HTML file.

# Testing this Polyfill
The tests use the [Mocha framework](https://mochajs.org/) with [Chai asserts](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/). Other Chai tools can be pulled in if needed.

To run the tests do
```
npm install
npm test
```
